Example of my workflow in response to the first practical activity. The purpose was to introduce students to data management and reproducible research concepts, and the ways in which R Markdown can meet the needs of effective documentation. 

<br>

The HTML output can be viewed here: [HTML](https://alycerussell.github.io/ClinicalBioinformatics_Module1_Week1_Practical)

You can choose to click on the HTML file links to follow on with the workshop. There's clickable links throughout, taking you directly to reference material so you can practise troubleshooting by yourselves. 

<br>

There's also code in the repository that you may find interesting for your own assessments, including:

* image about floating table of contents (CSS)

* automatic "Last Update" in the Date YAML option

* automatic numbering of tables and figures (CSS)

* adjustment of tables and figures caption font size (CSS)

* buttons to hide source code, output, or both, specific for chunks (CSS -- see also the "hideOutput.js" script)
